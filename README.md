# Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data. The dataset used for this project is the [Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis) from Kaggle.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands by performing sentiment analysis on tweets. We use the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool to classify tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Additionally, we visualize the sentiment patterns to gain deeper insights.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib nltk wordcloud
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ansarafsar/PRODIGY_Task_4.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd PRODIGY_Task_4
    ```

3. Place the dataset (`twitter_training.csv`) in the project directory.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis:
    ```bash
    PRODIGY_Task_4.ipynb
    ```

## Project Structure

- `PRODIGY_Task_4.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `twitter_training.csv`: The dataset file (you need to download this from Kaggle and place it in the project directory).

## Results

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the dataset and handle missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the distribution of sentiments and other relevant features.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Use VADER to compute sentiment scores and classify tweets.
4. **Visualization**: Generate word clouds, distribution plots, and other visualizations to understand sentiment patterns.
5. **Detailed Sentiment Analysis**: Explore relationships between tweet length, sentiment scores, and other features.
6. **Advanced Visualizations**: Use pair plots and heatmaps to identify deeper patterns in the data.
